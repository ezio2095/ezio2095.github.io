      I enjoy gaming, sports and music.<BR>
      -I enjoy playing games like Valorant, OSU! and Super Smash Brothers Ultimate.<BR>
      -Sports have played an important role in my life as it helped me to shape and be unique in the games I play or the way I communicate with my peers<BR>
      -Music has helped to shape the way I looked at certain things, although I did not study music theory, I was able to pick up an instrument and do well in it before I had to focus on my studies
    <H2 style = "color: black" class = "monospace">Background</H2>
    <P>Although my father is from the transportation industry, I was not able to learn much from him when it came down to anything IT. However it all changed 2 years ago when I started to put in effort to learn some form of IT. I was fortuante enough to have supportive parents where they were able to find me a course prior to me learning computing in school in2018. Due to that 1 exposure I had with coding it fueled my burning passion to learn how to code.With my gaming knowledge I was able to uncover that it uses C#(something that I took quite an interest in) and decided to try to make a project with that language. From then on I have been putting my utmost effort into the subject. Later i leared new skills in SQLite3 and Django in secondary 3 I also applied to study and AEM course about cybersecurity in Singapore Poly, thereby gaining an interest in other languages.

        I am a Secondary 4 student(16) in St Patrick's school, I take O'level with Computing, Chemistry and Physics as my main subjects.<BR>
    <p>I enjoy coming up with different game ideas for current games or new game ideas and try to code the idea into an algorithm to produce a game. When I am not coding, I am playing games, sports or learning a new trick.</p>

        I aim to be part of the game desgin or media desgin indusrty in the future.<br>
        <UL>
        <LI>Aiming to apply for a DGDD/DIM(Diploma in game design and developement/ DIploma in immersive media).     </LI>
            <LI>Aiming to achieve an aggregiate of 15 point or lower for GCE O'level  examination(L1R4).

        <H2 style = "color: black" class = "sanserif" >My hobbies/interest</H2> 
        I enjoy gaming, sports, magic and music.<BR>
        <UL style ="text-align: left">
        <LI>I enjoy playing games like Valorant, OSU! and Super Smash Brothers Ultimate. I play games frequently by myself (or in a team) as  stress releiver or even as a way to help me better communicate with others in game/IRL. Thorugh games I not only better understand how people work better as a group but how a simple contribution can affect the entire group morale or even the attitude towards say a common goal.</LI><BR>
        <LI>Sports have played an important role in my life as it helped me to shape and be unique in the games I play or the way I communicate with my peers. Such as squash, football and volleyball have taught me valuable values that people should have. By implementing it in my studies, I really feel as though I have persevered through my years in Secondary school as I was able to dilignetly progress from being in the Normal Academic stream to the express then Double Science class.</LI><BR>
        <LI>Although magic is mostly seen as a vice or something that is very misleading. However to me magic is as though we discover something new because in reality most of the fundamentals of magic is actually built from maths. So with that in mind I took it as new front to battle and soon I was actually able to conquer it and use it to my advantage to capture the minds of my audience. This really helped wiuth not only my attention but also my ability to absorb information quicker.</LI><BR>
        <LI>Music has helped to shape the way I looked at certain things, although I did not study music theory, I was able to pick up the drums and did well in it before I had to stop and focus on my studies.(I stopped at grade 4). By learning the Drums, I feel as though it really taught the basics of how hard work really pays off form putting in countless hours into doing basic skill training to learning songs to perform or play for simple pleasure too.</LI>

        <CENTER>
        <P>2 years ago I decided to learn some IT. As I was fortunate enough to have supportive parents who were able to find a suitable course for me to learn coding in 2018. Due to that 1 exposure I had with coding it fueled my burning passion to learn how to code. Since I was an avid gamer back then I learnt that some games were coded with the language C# and tried to make a simple game with it. Due to my school offering a subject in computing, I decided to apply for it and got accepted. Since then in school I have placed my utmost effort into the subject in school. And I have also learned new skills in the subject such as SQlite3 and Django as well as went for an AEM course that helped me to better understand the cybersecurity side of computing, all in the span of 1 year.

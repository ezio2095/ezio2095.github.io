        <CENTER>
        <P>2 years ago I decided to learn some IT. As I was fortuante enough to have supportive parents who were able to find a suitable course for me to learn coding in 2018. Due to that 1 exposure I had with coding it fueled my burning passion to learn how to code. Since I was an advid gamer back then I learnt that most games were coded with the language C# and tried to make a simple game with it. Due to my school offering a subject in computing, I decided to apply for it and got accepted. Since then in school I have placed my utmost effort into the subject in school. And I have also learned new skills in the subject such as SQlite3 and Django as well as went for an AEM course that helped me to better understand the cybersecurity side of computing, all in the span of 1 year.
